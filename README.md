# OpenNote (Working Title)

Client: HTML that uses TypeScript (JS) to make requests to the server with tRPC

Server: TypeScript (JS) which listens to requests and stores information in an SQL db

or I might just make it solo in php + sql, it's basically just frontend + db + security right

cohost/X/tumblr but beter with features like

- accounts
- open source :fire:
- be user-first (safe and friendly to all)
  - allow users to post an unlimited number of characters, include (limited) HTML/CSS, and upload images
  - dont run ads
  - dont show like-count, only people who liked
- tagging system + global tag (automatically added to every post)
- ability to indicate a post is sensitive (spoiler/sexually explicit/violence/whatever)
- reporting system (once no longer invite-only)
- comments don't exist; you are only able to "repost." your post can embed another post, which can itself embed a post, creating a long "thread." a thread exists as its own post distinct from the post it is embedding; the original post is unchanged (i.e. reposted content does not appear as part of the original like a comment would). however, the original poster is notified when someone reposts their post

how to not crash and burn

- dont pay employees, *maybe* have a plus-tier subscription (hobby/side-project, not company)
- optimize server usage (i.e. no video hosting idk)
- be like tumblr

compact webdesign like email :O

yo twitter ur a private company why do you care about supporting free speech, your appeal should be that you allow people to share what they do with others, you should be pro-user, be anti-drama, have decent media embeds for goodness sake

Follow system (I follow you to view your content; it's not reciprocal; for a site where you want to share the stuff you do)
Friend system (both sides must agree to being friends; for a site where you want to engage with others)

if I had infinite money I would buy twitter, remove the algorithm, make the "suggested follows" more prominent, and moderate it so heavily to not have political, I do not care about the news the trending tab can go too

if I was musk I would replace hashtags with a list of like 20 categories, like "Food," "Politics," "Media," "Celebrity," "Adult," "Technology," "Gaming," "Art," etc and then allow keyword search within those categories. then, make Xvideos, which uses the same category system as posts. maybe call it XTV instead lol
