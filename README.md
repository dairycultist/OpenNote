cohost but beter

- dont pay employees, *maybe* have a plus-tier subscription (hobby/side-project, not company)
- optimize server usage (i.e. no video hosting)
- be like tumblr
- be user-first (safe and friendly to all)
  - allow users to post as much text as they wanted and include (limited) HTML/CSS
  - image uploading
  - dont run ads
- reporting system once no longer invite-only

Client: HTML that uses TS (JS) to make requests to the server

Server: TS (JS) which listens to requests and stores information in an SQL db
