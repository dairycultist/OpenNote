# OpenNote
cohost but beter with features like

- accounts
- be user-first (safe and friendly to all)
  - allow users to post an unlimited number of characters, include (limited) HTML/CSS, and upload images
  - dont run ads
  - dont show like-count, only people who liked
- tagging system + global tag (automatically added to every post)
- ability to indicate a post is sensitive (spoiler/sexually explicit/violence/whatever)
- reporting system (once no longer invite-only)
- comments don't exist; you are only able to "repost." your post can embed another post, which can itself embed a post, creating a long "thread." a thread exists as its own post distinct from the post it is embedding; the original post is unchanged (i.e. reposted content does not appear as part of the original like a comment would). however, the original poster is notified when someone reposts their post

how to not crash and burn

- dont pay employees, *maybe* have a plus-tier subscription (hobby/side-project, not company)
- optimize server usage (i.e. no video hosting idk)
- be like tumblr

Client: HTML that uses TypeScript (JS) to make requests to the server with tRPC

Server: TypeScript (JS) which listens to requests and stores information in an SQL db

or I might just make it solo in php

yo twitter ur a private company why do you care about supporting free speech, your appeal should be that you allow people to share what they do with others, you should be pro-user, be anti-drama, have decent media embeds for goodness sake

I prefer Follow system (I follow you to view your content; it's not reciprocal) to Friend system (both sides must agree to being friends)

if I had infinite money I would buy twitter, remove the algorithm, make the "suggested follows" more prominent, and moderate it so heavily to not have political, I do not care about the news the trending tab can go too
